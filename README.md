# observe-geomagnetic-data
a repository to observe geomagnetic data for KDU and CKI stations

The geomagnetic stations KDU (Kakadu, Australia) and CKI (Cocos-Keeling Islands, Australia) are located in southern Indonesia, so there is a hypothesis that these data have a relationship with the earthquake that occurred in the southern of Indonesia (megathrust earthquake)
